# Hadoop_configuration_Ansible

I've created two Ansible Playbooks for Configuring both NameNode & DataNode in a Hadoop cluster.\

Ansible is a great tool for Configuration Management & Automation. This Task was given by Sir Vimal Daga in the Arth training recently.\
▪️ ARTH Task-11.1\
🔰 Write an Ansible PlayBook that does the following operations in the managed nodes:\
🔹 Configures NameNode\
🔹 Configure DataNode
Therefore, you can configure whole Hadoop Cluster using these codes using just 2 commands.

Hope you guys liked it and learned something new. Thankyou, I'll meet you in the next one. 😊
